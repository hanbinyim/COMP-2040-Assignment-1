# understanding the data
# how do we handle hyphenated words?
# treat them as multiple words
# we do not need to handle numbers
# same word with different capitalization is considered the same

# read data from the supplied file (input.txt)

# process the data (get it ready for ... ???)

# normalize (lower())
# tokenize (split())
# handle punctuation
# handle extra whitespace (strip())

# collect/accumulate stats (think about data structures)
# count the words (total and unique)
# count the chars (with and without whitespace)
# calculate the average word length
# find the most common word(s) dict()

# output the stats in the prescribed format
# output to console
# output to file
# !! no repeats!!
